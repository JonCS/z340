OK, here are my n-gram files for alice_oz.txt and for the Zodiac's writings. The first line in each file gives the number of distinct n-grams. Then all distinct n-grams are given in alphabetical order, with some additional info provided so that you can easily find all of the "follower" n-grams. For example,


ables 6 5831 12


means that this particular 5-gram appeared 6 times and the overlapping 5-grams (that is, the 5-grams that start with "bles") begin at position 5831 (indexed from 0), and there are 12 such overlapping 5-grams in this file.
